Our business concept was to develop an app that allows users to search theatres and book movie tickets. I began by creating the original repository base on GitHub and the database so that the group could begin working on the business that we created. Our project includes four parts, and we separated the jobs such that everyone is working on a different section of the program. 
My contribution was to create a book tickets module, where the user could choose their preferred seat and purchase the ticket. Any movie ticket purchasing has a criterion where if the customer's age is less than the age restriction for the movie, he will not be able to book the tickets. This module also contains a booking modification capability, allowing users to cancel their reservations or edit the customer's name.
I was also in charge of developing the Frontend framework (HTML + JavaScript) and creating APIs to interact between the Frontend framework and the backend (Python). I've also built up VMs on Azure for our application and a cloud database. My work also included combining the team's efforts in terms of module integration.

Contribution to the project: In the CA (two) assessment. I have contributed the section to show the user a list of nearby theatres based on location in sorted order. In this, I have created a function “get_theaters” which retrieves data from a database table named “Area”. It first establishes a database connection using the ‘openDbconnection()’ and assigns the resulting connection to a variable named cursor.
The function then creates an SQL query that selects all the records from the "Area" table and assigns it to a variable called getAreaQuery. The query is executed using the execute() method of the cursor object and the results are fetched using the fetchall() method and assigned to a variable called record.
The function converts the results into a list of tuples using a list comprehension and assigns the resulting list to a variable called r. Finally, the function returns a dictionary object with a single key-value pair where the key is "rows" and the value is the list of tuples r.
